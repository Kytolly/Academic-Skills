> A human-in-the-loop Codex skill suite that turns paper reading into staged, auditable research decisions.

Paper Reading Skills is a suite of Codex skills for early-stage research. It helps researchers organize paper reading around a clear research motivation at each stage and turn reading results into durable artifacts that can support the next research move.

Paper Reading Skills is built around staged confirmation. The agent proposes boundaries, paper sets, candidate questions, method needs, close works, claims, risks, and next steps; the researcher confirms, revises, rejects, or explicitly delegates consequential decisions before the workflow moves on. The intended outcome is that the researcher understands the project deeply enough to own the next decision.

In this loop, the agent broadens the search space, structures options, and challenges weak assumptions; the researcher learns the project, calibrates the direction, and supplies the judgments that only a human owner can make.

Efficient paper reading starts by clarifying these questions before reading:

* Why am I reading these papers?
* Which research decision am I trying to make right now?
* Which parts of the papers should I focus on?
* What should this reading session produce?
* When is it enough to stop?

This project breaks paper reading into a set of common research actions, with a workflow, input boundary, reading strategy, output format, and stopping condition for each action.

---

## Core Idea

Ordinary paper reading often aims at "finishing papers." This project aims at "making research judgments."

For example:

* When entering a new direction, start by building a field map instead of rushing into paper summaries.
* When you have an early idea, run a problem reality check before designing a method.
* When a method starts taking shape, pass through method commitment before treating it as a final plan.
* When preparing to write a paper, organize around close work, claim support, and positioning instead of broad related-work collection.

Each skill corresponds to a concrete research stage and produces artifacts that downstream workflows can consume.

---

## What Makes This Different

Paper Reading Skills treats research as a collaborative decision process, not a fully automated content-generation task.

* Stage gates keep important choices visible: field boundaries, seed papers, method needs, candidate methods, experiment claims, close works, and final commitments are reviewed before they drive downstream work.
* The agent is an active research partner: it searches, structures, compares, challenges, and recommends, but it does not silently turn its own recommendation into the researcher's commitment.
* The researcher stays inside the loop: they learn the project while making decisions, correct the agent's framing, and provide judgment where literature evidence alone is not enough.
* Delegation is recorded rather than disguised as confirmation. If the researcher asks for a more automatic run, the output stays provisional where key gates were not reviewed.

This is meant to create research ownership. By the end of a workflow, the researcher should be able to explain the boundary, evidence, risks, alternatives, and next move, rather than merely receive an impressive document about a topic they still do not know.

## Skill Map

| Stage | Skill | Research Question It Helps Answer | Main Output |
| ----- | ----- | --------------------------------- | ----------- |
| 01 | Field Map | What are the main branches, method routes, and research opportunities in this field? | Field map / research clusters / opportunity candidates |
| 02 | Research Question | Which gaps can become actionable research questions? | Research question cards |
| 03 | Problem Reality Check | Is this problem real, or only superficially plausible? | Problem justification / risk notes |
| 04 | Theoretical Grounding | Is there theoretical support that can strengthen the problem framing? | Theoretical grounding package |
| 05 | Method Inspiration | Which mechanisms from papers can be transferred into candidate methods? | Method candidate library |
| 06 | Method Commitment | Is the current method stable enough for the researcher to own? | Committed / provisional / redesign / rejected method outcome |
| 07 | Experiment Design | How can claims be translated into verifiable experiment designs? | Experiment plan / baseline pressure matrix / claim-metric map |
| 08 | Research Framing | How should this research be positioned in the paper narrative and related-work comparison? | Research framing package |
| Utility | Research Notebook | How can one paper become a portable, evidence-linked Markdown note? | Notebook / source record / original figure and table captures |
| Extra | Workspace Presentation | How can an existing research workspace become a browsable, handoff-ready interface? | Interactive presentation workspace |

## Output Modes

Paper Reading Skills is designed to produce research artifacts in different forms depending on the task scale and review need. The screenshots below show three output modes: large-task field investigation, process-level documentation, and full-workflow visualization.

### Large-Task Field Investigation

</p>

For broad research tasks such as entering a new field, the Field Map Workflow turns scattered papers into a visual HTML report. It organizes the Field Boundary, Seed Set, Search Strategy, Research Clusters, Paper Table, Research Opportunity Candidates, and Next Actions into a single browsable surface.

This mode is useful because:

* it supports shallow-to-deep reading: users can start from coverage counts, clusters, and opportunities, then drill into source notes;
* it turns a large, fuzzy literature task into a structured investigation path;
* it keeps the report lightweight and shareable through zero-build static HTML.

### Process Records And Decision Trace

<p>

</p>

The workflows also produce full process records, not only polished summaries. The example above shows how method work is recorded with source workspace, transfer mapping, Candidate Methods, Method Thesis, covered and uncovered Method Needs, source patterns, status, and weakest link.

This mode is useful because:

* decisions remain auditable: later readers can see what was selected, deferred, rejected, or still fragile;
* intermediate reasoning stays visible instead of disappearing into chat history;
* staged confirmation records show where the researcher agreed, revised, delegated, or blocked a recommendation;
* downstream workflows can inherit source links, open risks, and decision status without guessing how the result was produced.

### Full-Workflow Visualization

</p>

For mature research chains, the Workspace Presentation skill can generate a complex interactive React/Vite web interface that visualizes the whole research flow. It can connect method design, experiment design, research framing, risks, source trace, next actions, and source-file previews in one navigable workspace.

This mode is useful because:

* it makes the overall research state reviewable at a glance while preserving links back to source artifacts;
* it turns a multi-stage research process into a presentation-quality interface for handoff, rereading, or project review;
* it keeps decisions, evidence, risks, and next actions visible together instead of scattering them across folders.

## Workflow

The skills are designed as a research pipeline:

```text
Field Map
  |
  v
Research Question
  |
  v
Problem Reality Check
  |
  v
Theoretical Grounding
  |
  v
Method Inspiration
  |
  v
Method Commitment
  |
  v
Experiment Design
  |
  v
Research Framing
  |
  v
Workspace Presentation
```

This pipeline is not strictly linear. Users can start from any stage depending on their current research state.

For example:

* If the user is new to a field, start with `skills/01-field-map`.
* If the user already has an idea but is unsure whether it is valid, start with `skills/03-problem-reality-check`.
* If the user has several candidate methods, start with `skills/06-method-commitment`.
* If the user already has a stable method and wants to design experiments, start with `skills/07-experiment-design`.

```

This repository also includes `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, so installers compatible with the Claude Code plugin manifest ecosystem can discover the same skill set explicitly.

### Manual Setup

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/snake-fan/Paper-Reading-Skills.git
cd Paper-Reading-Skills
```

Each skill lives under `skills/`:

```text
skills/
├── 01-field-map/
├── 02-research-question/
├── 03-problem-reality-check/
├── 04-theoretical-grounding/
├── 05-method-inspiration/
├── 06-method-commitment/
├── 07-experiment-design/
├── 08-research-framing/
├── research-notebook/
└── workspace-presentation/
```

Before using a skill, identify the current research state:

```text
I am currently trying to:
- understand a field
- find a research question
- verify whether a problem is real
- find theoretical support
- get method inspiration
- commit to a method
- design experiments
- frame the paper
```

Then invoke the corresponding skill in Codex.

Example prompt:

```text
Use the field-map skill to help me map the research field of memory safety in LLM agents.
I want to identify major branches, representative papers, evaluation settings, saturated areas, and possible research opportunities.
```

## Output Philosophy

Each skill is designed to produce durable research artifacts, not temporary chat summaries.

The outputs should be:

* traceable: important claims should connect back to papers or prior artifacts;
* decision-oriented: each artifact should help the user make a research decision;
* participatory: major workflow gates should invite the researcher to confirm, revise, reject, or explicitly delegate the next move;
* reusable: downstream skills should be able to consume upstream outputs;
* bounded: each workflow should have clear stopping conditions;
* honest about uncertainty: weak evidence, unresolved risks, and unsafe claims should be explicitly recorded.

---

## Design Principles

### 1. Motivation-first reading

The project assumes that paper reading should start from the user's current research motivation, not from a generic summary template.

### 2. Artifact-driven workflow

Every skill writes structured artifacts so that research progress does not disappear inside chat history.

### 3. Human-owned decisions

The agent can propose, organize, attack, and summarize, but important research commitments should remain visible to the user and owned by the researcher. A recommendation is not treated as a commitment until the relevant gate is confirmed or explicitly delegated.

### 4. Downstream routing discipline

Not every output should be passed downstream. For example, a weak problem should not automatically enter method design, and a provisional method should not be treated as experiment-ready.

### 5. Evidence-aware framing

The project avoids turning weak evidence into strong claims. It records what can be safely claimed, what needs more support, and what should be avoided.
